# python-paint-game
Dynamic paint program built using pygame. 4 color options, an erase button, and a clear button.

This is a very simple recreation of the microsoft paint application. It only has 6 buttons: 4 color options, an erase button and a clear button.


The program is dynamic, meaning that its main functionality can be adjusted easily from the settings file. 

You can choose to have grid lines, change the fps, change the pixel size, font type etc, by adjusting the values in this file.


(If you want smaller pixels, increase the number of rows and columns until you reach the desired size. You can change the rgb values in the settings folder, as well, in order to change the colors. 

Program default is 50 rows, 50 columns. 100 rows, 100 columns would create smaller pixels)

Requires pygame.


To install pygame, in your terminal type in: pip install pygame.


Hope you enjoy! :)
